  "Parity tests against a synthetic scene fixture (the real OSM-baked Shibuya
  fixture is unavailable in this checkout — see README). These exercise the
  same properties the original Rust `#[cfg(test)]` module checked, adapted
  to the ported (pre-physics) scope: scene parses; building-obstacles count
  matches building count; objects carry valid attrs; every object kind
  resolves a footprint + colour; agent-urdf produces well-formed-looking
  4-DOF XML."
